  # method 'handle' on it.
  # The result of the handle method invocation always has #to_s called on it.
  # The last line of the content should be the name of that class, so that it
  # is returned by "eval" and we can instantiate it.
  # If the dynasnip needs access to the 'context' (i.e. probably the request
  # itself), it should be a subclass of Dynasnip (or define an initializer
  # that accepts the context as its first argument).
