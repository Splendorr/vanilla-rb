Vanilla.rb
==========

The base flavour. The classic ice cream.

And the freakiest wiki-wonki-wiki-wonki-wiki-wonki-wickedy-wiki you've ever seen. 

But you must not fear; fear is the mind-killer; fear is the little death that brings total oblivion; 
fear is the chilling terror that makes you believe that *everything* is better when Model lays with 
Controller and View in peace.

Vanilla.rb cries "HERESY!" upon that layered orgy of filth. Vanilla.rb says "EMBRACE CHAOS!". Vanilla.rb
says "EVERY SNIP FOR THEMSELVES!". Vanilla.rb waits quietly, in the dark corners.

Use at your own risk; really. I showed it to a cat, and the cat started talking in French. It was MESSED. UP.


Usage
=====

$ ruby vanilla/bootstrap.rb

... a bunch of stuff gets created

$ ruby vanilla/snips_on_sinatra.rb
