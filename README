Vanilla.rb
==========

The base flavour. The classic ice cream.

And the freakiest wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki you've ever seen.

Use at your own risk; really. I showed it to a cat, and the cat started talking in French. It was MESSED. UP.


Usage
=====

$ ruby vanilla/bootstrap.rb

... a bunch of stuff gets created

$ ruby vanilla/snips_on_sinatra.rb

... the wiki starts. THE PAIN BEGINS.
