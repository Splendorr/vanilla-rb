                      WELCOME IN VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
                                 VANILLA
What you've got:

  config.ru  - this is the rack configuration, which is used to start
               the application by your webserver
  config.yml - the configuration; by default it specifies the directory
               which contains the soup(s)
  soup/      - the default soup directory, where your snips are stored
  

For an overview of vanilla, start your site and look at the tutorial:

  $ rackup   # then open http://localhost:9292/vanilla-rb-tutorial


You can edit any file in the soup directory using your favourite editor, 
and the changes will be reflected automatically. The snip files are
slightly modified YAML files. Here's one describing Soup itself, in 
soup/system/tutorial/soup.snip:

  Soup is a data store supporting the {link_to snip}-space that {link_to vanilla-rb} expects.

  It's hosted on github [here][github].

The 'content' of the snip is at the top of the file, followed by the
rest of the snip attributes. Again, see the online tutorial for information
about what each attribute signifies.
